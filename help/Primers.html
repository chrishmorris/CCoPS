                          <p>You can provide the DNA sequence alone, or a FASTA representation of it.
                          You provide it in one of the following ways.
                          </p>
                         <ul>
                           <li>Paste the text into the box on the page.</li>

                           <li>(Soon) Choose a database and provide the accession number.</li>

                        <h3>(Optional) Specifying PCR conditions</h3>
                        <p>There is a form defining the PCR conditions you intend to use.
                        Clcik where it says "PCR Conditions" to see it.
                        This is used to calculate the Tm of the primers.
                        The defaults are often appropriate, but you can also change them.
                        Please contact us if you want us to include other options in this form.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Changing start, end, and length of primers</h3>
                        <p>When you have supplied the target sequence, 
                        PLan will suggest primer sequences suitable for amplifying the full length sequence.
                        If you change the start or end codon, then it will recalculate them.
                        </p>
                        <p>The suggested primers have a melting temperature greater that the minimum Tm you requested,
                        but no more than 5C above it. If possible, they also end in C or G. 
                        To lengthen a primer, click on it. To shorten a primer, right click on it. 
                        </p>

                        <h3>Designing extra primers</h3>
                        <p>To add another forward or reverse primer for a given target, click "+", 
                        then set the start or end codon.

                        <h3>Designing primers for several targets</h3>
                        <p>If you supply a FASTA file representing several targets, 
                        the table will contain primers for all of them. 
                        </p>
                        <p>These primers are all designed using the same conditions,
                        so it will be possible to perform the PCR processes together.</p>
                    </section><section>
                        <h3>Potential problems in PCR</h3>
                        <p>For each primer, PLan reports the Tm of a possible hairpin.
                        If you put your mouse over this, PLan will display the alignment of the hairpin. 
                        </p>
                        <p>For each target, PLan reports the Tm of a possible primer dimer.
                        If you have designed more than two primers,
                        the number reported is the highest Tm of any pair of 
                        a forward primer and reverse primer. 
                        If you put your mouse over this, PLan will display the alignment of the primer dimer.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The annealing temperature that you use should be higher 
                        than the worst hairpin or primer dimer in the reactions you are performing. 
                        </p>
