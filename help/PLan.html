                    <h1>Protein Lab NoteBook (TM)</h1>
                    <p>PLan is an initial attempt to develop an Electronic Laboratory Notebook for recombinant protein expression.

                    <section><h3>What PLan will do</h3>
                    <p>PLan is an electronic lab notebook designed to support protein recombination. Its design goal is to help with the most pressing information management needs of scientists who express protein, in a way that provides a smooth progression to full provenance tracking. 
</p><p>Plan will offer solutions for small daily housekeeping problems, in a way that adds up to a comprehensive data management solution for the lab. Scientists will interact with the system via mobile devices when away from the lab; desktop computers in the office; and wall mounted touch screens, bar code readers, and desktop computers in the lab; and also by email and by using reports exported from the system.
</p><p>PLan will provide calculators and news services of use to structural biologists.  PLan will also provide a file archive for gel images and other laboratory files, and a structured data store to record the provenance of these files. It will help manage booking laboratory instruments, keeping track of samples in freezers, managing and reporting on projects, and standard operating procedures including special support for protocols for processing DNA.
</p><p>PLan will be compatible with the laboratory information management system PiMS.

                    <section><h3>Devices</h3>
                        <p>You will soon be able to install a copy of PLan as an application 
                        on your desktop or mobile device. 
                        Parts of PLan work even if you have no network connection. Other parts require you to be online.

                    <section><h3>Support</h3>
                    <p>PLan is being developed by Chris Morris, STFC. 
                    Thanks to <a href="http://www.biomedbridges.eu">BioMedBridges</a>
                    and <a href="http://www.ccp4.ac.uk">CCP4</a> 
                    for support to develop this prototype.</p>

                        <h3>Future developments</h3>
                        <p>This is an early prototype, intended to serve as a proof of concept.
                        If support is obtained, PLan will be extended as described above.

               <aside><h3>Why PLan?</h3><p>
The genomic revolution posed more questions than it answered. Many of these questions are in the scope of protein science, 
and for many investigations the first step is to produce a sample of the protein by recombinant expression. 
This demand, along with the development of more effective methods by structural genomic projects, has resulted in growth of recombinant protein expression. 
Traditional methods of tracking laboratory activity have proved unequal to this challenge. 
</p><p>
There are increasing demands from funding sources that research data should be archived and shared. This has not yet resulted in an actual change in lab practice. 
Paradoxically, some of the most technically advanced workplaces on Earth keep records partly by the same method that Galileo used: a notebook.
